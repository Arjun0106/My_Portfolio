            <h3><br>✦ Food ERP System</h3>
            <p><br>A Food ERP System, which is an mobile application specifically designed for college canteens. The main objective of the project is to simplify the food ordering process and accurately predict the sales for the day.<br><br>By utilizing data analytics and predictive modeling this system has achieved accuracy in forecasting sales leading to improved food preparation and shorter queues. This project highlights my work in mobile app development, data analysis, predictive modeling and problem solving skills.</p>

            <h3><br>✦ Grok-It with Gemini</h3>
            <p><br>I've developed a mobile application capable of recognizing physical or real-world objects through the mobile camera or images stored in the mobile's storage to provide comprehensive information about the objects present in it. This application has been developed using Kotlin, Firebase and Google's Gemini AI 1.5 Flash API. This application is specially developed to participate in Google's Gemini API Developer Competition.</p>

        <div class="project4">
            <h3><br>✦ Movement Detection Module using Python & OpenCV</h3>
            <p><br>I've created a system module that detects movement using Python, OpenCV, Pandas and a webcam. Using OpenCV's image processing features, I developed an application that can track and identify motion in real-time through the webcam. The collected data is then analyzed using Pandas, providing insights into the patterns of detected movement.</p>

            <h3><br>✦ Attendance Management System for Working Employees/Staffs</h3>
            <p><br>Our team and myself has successfully developed a Attendance Calculation App using Android Studio and Google Apps Scripts. This innovative tool aims to simplify attendance management for college staff by leveraging technologies. Through the app we are able to calculate metrics such, as Sick Leave (SL) Casual Leave (CL) and Loss of Pay (LoP). By handling attendance data this app improves efficiency while ensuring accurate and dependable leave calculations.</p>
